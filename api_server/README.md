# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.


## Requirements
Python 3.7+
MongoDB 4+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the api_server directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m openapi_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/my-temp-service/0.0.1/ui/
```


## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t my-temp-service .

# starting up a MongoDB container
docker run -it -p 27017:27017 mongo:4


# starting up a container
docker run -p 8082:8082 my-temp-service
```
